<h3>오늘의 진도</h3>

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)에서 Applied Accessibility 코스 진행중

오늘 배운 내용들은 여태까지 배운 것들 중 제일 흥미로웠다. 웹 개발 지식에 사회학적 함의를 담은 느낌이랄까. 
<br>접근성을 높이는 건 단순히 장애인들의 편의만 높이는 게 아니고 그야말로 모든 유저들의 편의를 높이는 거니까 장기적인 관점에서 봤을 때도 훨씬 유용하고 가치있다는 점이 멋있다.

<h3>주의해야 할 부분</h3>

><b>Note about ```section``` and ```div```</b><br>
>The ```section``` element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than ```article```. An ```article``` is for standalone content, 
and a ```section``` is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the ```article```,
 then each chapter is a ```section```. When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a ```div```.

>div - groups content<br>
>section - groups related content<br>
>article - groups independent, self-contained content

 - [링크](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-accessibility/use-tabindex-to-add-keyboard-focus-to-an-element)

><b>Note</b>: A negative ```tabindex``` value (typically -1) indicates that an element is focusable, but is not reachable by the keyboard. 
This method is generally used to bring focus to content programmatically (like when a ```div``` used for a pop-up window is activated), 
and is beyond the scope of these challenges.
