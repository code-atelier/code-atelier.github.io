<h3>오늘의 진도</h3>

[CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/)에서 <CS50x 2021> 진행중

 - pset7 fiftyville 완료
 
<hr>

<h3>배운 점</h3>

 - fiftyville은 장담컨대 cs50에서 가장 재밌는 과제일것이다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 프로그래밍을 공부하면서 내가 너무 사랑해 마지 않는 추리 게임(비슷한 것)을 할 수 있을 줄은 정말 상상도 못했었는데 
 이렇게 즐거운 경험을 하게 돼서 너무 기쁘고 뿌듯하다. 과제 설명을 읽어 보니 SQL City라는 문제에서 영감을 얻어서 만든 문제라고 적혀있던데 cs50 과정을 모두 끝내고 나면 SQL 복습도 할 겸 
 원본 문제도 풀어봐야겠다.
 [SQL City](http://mystery.knightlab.com/)
 
 - week7 SQL은 전반적으로 여태까지 한 cs50 수업 중 가장 쉽고 재밌었던 것 같다. SQL도 파고들면 어렵고 복잡해지겠지만 입문 단계의 기초적인 내용은 그 어떤 언어보다도 쉽고 빠르게 배웠다. 
 덕분에 어려운 회차들을 겪으면서 점차 피폐해진 내 멘탈을 어느 정도 회복시켜주고 계속해서 프로그래밍 공부를 해도 괜찮겠다는 희망을 심어줌...ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 고마워 SQL!!
 
 - fiftyville 풀이를 한번에 잘 해낸 게 너무 뿌듯한 나머지 여기에도 쓴 코드를 올리고 싶은데 너무 내용이 길어서 접기 하는 방법까지 공부했다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ하지만 주석도 정말 열심히 썼단 말야...
 영어 공부까지 아주 알차게 함ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

<summary>Fiftyville log.sql</summary>

```sql

-- Keep a log of any SQL queries you execute as you solve the mystery.

-- 1. Take information from crime scene reports
SELECT description FROM crime_scene_reports WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND street = "Chamberlin Street";
-- Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Chamberlin Street courthouse. Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time — each of their interview transcripts mentions the courthouse.

-- 1) theft took place at 10:15am at the Chamberlin Street courthouse

-- 2. Check witness' interviews
SELECT name, transcript FROM interviews WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND transcript LIKE "%thief%" ORDER BY name;
-- Eugene | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse, I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
-- Raymond | As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
-- Ruth | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the courthouse parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the courthouse parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

-- 1) thief withdrew money from the atm on Fifer Street before Eugene's arrival to the courthouse
-- 2) thief took the first flight out of town the day after theft, accomplice bought the ticket, they made a phone call for less than a minute
-- 3) around 10 minutes of the theft, the thief took the car in the courthouse parking lot

-- 3. Check Eugene's testimony : check Eugene's time of courthouse arrival, and check the atm transaction on Fifer street before that time
SELECT license_plate FROM people WHERE name = "Eugene"; -- 47592FJ
SELECT year, month, day, hour, minute, activity FROM courthouse_security_logs WHERE license_plate = "47592FJ";
-- 2020 | 7 | 26 | 13 | 22 | entrance
-- 2020 | 7 | 26 | 17 | 27 | exit
-- 2020 | 7 | 30 | 8 | 53 | entrance
-- 2020 | 7 | 30 | 15 | 45 | exit

-- Eugene did not use his car to go to the courthouse on the theft day, thus left no record of his arrival time

-- Check for the atm transactions - 1st suspect list
SELECT DISTINCT(name) FROM people
JOIN bank_accounts ON people.id = bank_accounts.person_id
JOIN atm_transactions ON atm_transactions.account_number = bank_accounts.account_number
WHERE atm_transactions.account_number IN
(SELECT account_number FROM atm_transactions WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND atm_location = "Fifer Street" AND transaction_type = "withdraw")
ORDER BY name;
-- Bobby
-- Danielle
-- Elizabeth
-- Ernest
-- Madison
-- Roy
-- Russell
-- Victoria


-- 4. Check Raymond's testimony : check the first flight out of town on 2020/7/29
SELECT full_name, city, hour, minute FROM flights
JOIN airports ON origin_airport_id = airports.id
WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 29 ORDER BY hour;

SELECT full_name, city, hour, minute FROM flights
JOIN airports ON destination_airport_id = airports.id
WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 29 ORDER BY hour;

-- thief took the flight to Heathrow Airport, London at 8:20am

-- get names of the passenger = 2nd suspect list
SELECT name FROM people WHERE passport_number IN (SELECT passport_number FROM passengers
JOIN flights ON passengers.flight_id = flights.id
WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 29 AND hour = 8 AND minute = 20 AND flight_id =
(SELECT id FROM flights WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 29 AND hour = 8 AND minute = 20)) ORDER BY name;
-- Bobby
-- Danielle
-- Doris
-- Edward
-- Ernest
-- Evelyn
-- Madison
-- Roger


-- 5. Check Ruth's testimony : check courthouse security logs - 3rd suspect list
SELECT name FROM people WHERE license_plate IN (SELECT license_plate FROM courthouse_security_logs
WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND hour = 10 AND minute > 15 AND minute < 25 AND activity = "exit") ORDER BY name;
-- Amber
-- Danielle
-- Elizabeth
-- Ernest
-- Evelyn
-- Patrick
-- Roger
-- Russell

-- 6. Intersect three suspect list
SELECT DISTINCT(name) FROM people
JOIN bank_accounts ON people.id = bank_accounts.person_id
JOIN atm_transactions ON atm_transactions.account_number = bank_accounts.account_number
WHERE atm_transactions.account_number IN
(SELECT account_number FROM atm_transactions WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND atm_location = "Fifer Street" AND transaction_type = "withdraw")
INTERSECT
SELECT name FROM people WHERE passport_number IN (SELECT passport_number FROM passengers
JOIN flights ON passengers.flight_id = flights.id
WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 29 AND hour = 8 AND minute = 20 AND flight_id =
(SELECT id FROM flights WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 29 AND hour = 8 AND minute = 20))
INTERSECT
SELECT name FROM people WHERE license_plate IN (SELECT license_plate FROM courthouse_security_logs
WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND hour = 10 AND minute > 15 AND minute < 25 AND activity = "exit") ORDER BY name;
-- Danielle
-- Ernest

-- 7. Check Raymond's testimony 2 : lookup for thief and accomplice's phone call record
SELECT name FROM people WHERE phone_number IN (SELECT caller FROM phone_calls WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND duration < 60) ORDER BY name;
-- Bobby
-- Ernest
-- Evelyn
-- Kimberly
-- Madison
-- Roger
-- Russell
-- Victoria

SELECT name FROM people WHERE phone_number IN (SELECT receiver FROM phone_calls WHERE year = 2020 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND duration < 60) ORDER BY name;
-- Anna
-- Berthold
-- Doris
-- Jack
-- Jacqueline
-- James
-- Larry
-- Melissa
-- Philip

-- Final suspect : Ernest, accomplice : Berthold
